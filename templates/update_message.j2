{% if new_changes %}
I looked at your changes (based on {{ used_commit }}), and it turns out they will cause some changes in [zhinst-qcodes](https://github.com/zhinst/zhinst-qcodes).
{% if new_branch %}
I took the liberty to create a new branch [`{{ branch_name }}`]({{ branch_url }}) in [zhinst-qcodes](https://github.com/zhinst/zhinst-qcodes) and committed the changes to it ({{ commit_url }}).
{% else %}
I took the liberty to commit the changes to the already existing branch [`{{ branch_name }}`]({{ branch_url }}) ({{ commit_url }}).
{% endif %}
Take a look at the corresponding [pull request]({{ pull_request }}). I will keep it up to date. If you want, you can adapt it yourself.

I looked at your recent changes, and it does not seem to affect the autogenerated part of [zhinst-qcodes](https://github.com/zhinst/zhinst-qcodes). Please double check that!
I will continue to check any new changes that migh happen.
